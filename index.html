<h1>All About Coffee</h1>
<aside>
  <p>
We want to do a lot of stuff; we're not in great shape. We didn't get a good night's sleep. We're a little depressed. Coffee solves all these problems in one delightful little cup.
- Jerry Seinfeld

Coffee preparation is the process of turning coffee beans into a beverage. While the particular steps vary with the type of coffee and with the raw materials, the process includes four basic steps; raw coffee beans must be roasted, the roasted coffee beans must then be <a href="grinding.html">ground</a>, the ground coffee must then be mixed with hot water for a certain time (brewed), and finally the liquid coffee must be separated from the used <a href="grinding.html">grounds</a>.

Coffee is usually <a href=brewing.html>brewed</a> immediately before drinking. In most areas, coffee may be purchased unprocessed, or already <a href="roasting.html">roasted</a>, or already <a href="roasting.html">roasted</a> and ground. Coffee is often vacuum packed to prevent oxidation and lengthen its shelf life
